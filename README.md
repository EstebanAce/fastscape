# FastScape

A fast, versatile, extensible and user-friendly Landscape Evolution Model (LEM).

**This project is currently under heavy development.**

This Python package provides a lot a small model components to use with the
[xarray-simlab](https://github.com/benbovy/xarray-simlab) modeling framework.
These components can readily be combined together in order to create
many model variants that are auto-documented.

Routines from the [fastscapelib](https://github.com/fastscape-lem/fastscapelib)
library are used for fast model execution.
