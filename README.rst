FastScape
=========

A fast, versatile and user-friendly Landscape Evolution Model (LEM).

**This project is currently under heavy development.**

This Python package provides a lot a small model components to use
with the xarray-simlab_ modeling framework. These components can
readily be combined together in order to create many model variants
that are auto-documented.

Routines from the fastscapelib_ library are used for fast model
execution.
